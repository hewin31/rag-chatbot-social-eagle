# RAG Document Ingestion — Phase 1 Skeleton

This repository contains the Phase‑1 skeleton for a trust-first RAG document ingestion POC.

## Phase 1 Focus

- Document registry and metadata extraction
- Probe engine scaffolding
- Deterministic parsing stubs
- SQL lineage (PostgreSQL)

See `docs/USAGE.md` for quick commands.

## Philosophy

Trust-first, audit-driven ingestion with deterministic extraction and full lineage.
No ML hallucination, no blind parsing — every decision is reviewable.
